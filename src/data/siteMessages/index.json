Recently, some stuff happened whereby a fine fellow wrapped Braytech in a \"webview\", added Google Adsense, and deployed it to the Google Play store for Android users every where. I didn't like this.\n\nI like to make beautiful ad-less experiences and when someone counterfeits your sfotware, it can be pretty demoralising.\n\nPlease be nice to each other and don't do dumb things like invade while carrying motes.\n\nThank you."
